I just want to say this simply. I'm really thankful for you.
Since July 19, 2023, being with you has been one of the best parts of my life.
I like being with you. I like how easy things feel when we talk, laugh, or even stay quiet. You make my days better without trying.
So this Valentine's Day, I just want to ask you one thing
Can I be your Valentine, My Chinie?"*
